My name is Arie Marie Mikael Dalleis. I am 29 years old. I live in Elmhurst, Queens, New York. I like coffee and tea, cats and dogs. I love the sea.

I'm an artist and computer scientist exploring the intersection of these two disciplines. Art is a medium I use to tell stories and understand myself. Computers are a positive obsession where constantly push myself into uncomfortable territory where I have to decide that "I can get this." Programming teaches me to use my mind in new ways; to be both rigorous and patient.

My core strengths: empathy, conceptual connections, curiosity about limits.  Empathy: I started the Brooklyn chapter of ASCA in 2015, a support group for people who survived crappy childhoods.  Connecting disciplines: When I draw I sometimes make functions in my head, as if I'm writing a program for the drawing. When I code, I think about sketches and how the first draft is just the first idea. Curiousity: I'm fascinated by what  it means to be a person with a brain that is capable of forming new neural connectons thoughout it's lifetime. This brain is attached to a body that can interact with the world. There are tons of these brain-body beings in the world. What are limits of what one mind can thought-create. What are the limits of what many connected minds can synthesize?
